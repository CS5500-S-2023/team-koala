# __Koala Reminder Bot__
Koala Reminder is a discord chatbot that reminds discord users of their packages or events. Discord users need to interact with the bot via commands.

# Functionalities
Reminds users of status updates of their packages via discord private messages.
- Currently, this bot supports creating, updating, updating and deleting packages.
- Once users have created packages with the bot, they will be notified daily (from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. PST) if there are any updates.
    - Adaptability to users in time zones that is not PST is in the plan.



Reminds users of events via discord private messages
- Currently, this bot only supports creating reminders/events that repeats or don't repeat. User facing delete functionality is not yet implemented. Regarding deleting / stopping the reminders please refer to details in [Reminder Commands](#reminder-commands) section below.
- This bot supports reminders in all 24 time zones with the default time zone being GMT-7 (PDT).
> Note: This documentation uses the word **reminder** interchagebaly with the word **event**.


# Pakcage Commands
### `/add-package`
- Options:

    - tracking_number (required): the tracking number of a package/shipment.

    - name (optional): a name for the package, strongly suggested for identifying packages.
      - When Koala Reminder bot sends users updates of their packages, they can easily recognize their packages by name, otherwise by tracking number.

- Users will then be prompted to select the carrier of the package (input required).
    - Supported carriers:

        UPS, DHL, FedEx, USPS, LaserShip, China-post, China Ems International, GLS, Canada Post, Purolator

        > Note:<br>
        The above 10 carriers are what we think are popular based on personal experiences and online searches.<br>
        For the current UI design, we can support at most 25 carriers. <br>
        Feel free to suggest any carriers you want to include and we will respond to you if that carrier is supported.

- Confirmation messages
    - If the combination of the tracking number and carrier id is valid, users will receive a confirmation message indicating success.
    - Otherwise, users will receive a message indicating the failure of adding the package.

### `/display-packages`
- To see all packages with latest status that current users created

### `/delete-package`
- Options:
    - package ID (required) to delete a specific package that current users have created

# Development
This is a Gradle project written in Java 17. The project utilizes Dagger framework for dependency injection, Discord JDA for Discord interaction and MongoDB for data storage, and a third-party service KeyDelivery for package tracking, running on fly.io. <br><br>
The skeleton of this project is set up by @abl at this [repo](https://github.com/abl/bot) üëè
## Deploying this Project to a Bot Application on Discord
- Please refer to this [link](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-create-discord-bot/) to create a bot application and generate bot tokens.
- In the terminal, at the root path of the cloned project in your local environment / online codespace, do export BOT_TOKEN=[your generated bot token].
- In the terminal, type in ./gradlew run, and the code will be running on your bot application.

## Connecting to MongoDB
- Please refer to this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VnlAC4TKOfoEuJhqoeGt6jn3dgVf3ulPvvVPQkEQnFE/) to set up a connection string in MongoDB Atlas.
- In the terminal, at the root path of the cloned project in your local environment / online codespace, do export MONGODB_URI=[your MongoDB connection string].

## Connecting to the third-party service - KeyDelivery
- Please register an account on [KeyDelivery](https://www.kd100.com/docs/keydelivery-api)
- After logging in, retrieve the unique SECRET and API_KEY. Then do export KEY_DELIVERY_API_SECRET=<your_secret> <br>
export KEY_DELIVERY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

 ## Deploying on fly.io
